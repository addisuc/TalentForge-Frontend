## Notes

### Architecture Decisions Made
1. **Single-tenant model for clients**: Each client has separate login per recruiting agency
2. **Candidates search globally**: Candidates see jobs from all tenants/agencies
3. **Role hierarchy**: PLATFORM_ADMIN > TENANT_ADMIN > RECRUITING_MANAGER > RECRUITER > CLIENT > CANDIDATE

### Technical Debt
- None identified yet (new project)

### Future Considerations (Post-Phase 1)
- Two-factor authentication (2FA)
- Social login (Google, LinkedIn, Microsoft)
- Single Sign-On (SSO) for enterprise clients
- Biometric authentication for mobile
- OAuth 2.0 provider for third-party integrations

2. Start with high-priority security enhancements
3. Implement password recovery flow
4. Add email verification
5. Begin unit testing setup
