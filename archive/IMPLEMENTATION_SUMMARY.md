# Role-Based Dashboard Implementation Summary

## What We've Implemented

### 1. NavigationService (NEW)
**Location**: `src/app/core/services/navigation.service.ts`

**Purpose**: Centralized service for all role-based navigation logic

**Features**:
- `getNavigationForRole(role)` - Returns navigation items for specific role
- `getDashboardRoute(role)` - Returns dashboard route for specific role
- `isPlatformRole(role)` - Checks if role is platform-level
- `isTenantRole(role)` - Checks if role is tenant-level

**Navigation Map**:
- PLATFORM_ADMIN → Dashboard, Tenants, Billing, System
- BILLING_MANAGER → Dashboard, Subscriptions, Reports
- TENANT_ADMIN → Dashboard, Team, Jobs, Candidates, Settings
- RECRUITER → Dashboard, Jobs, Applications, Candidates, Clients, Team, Analytics
- CANDIDATE → Dashboard, Job Search, My Applications, Interviews, Profile, Messages

### 2. Main Layout Component (REFACTORED)
**Location**: `src/app/layouts/main-layout/main-layout.component.ts`

**Changes**:
- Uses NavigationService to get navigation items
- Subscribes to currentUser$ from AuthService
- Dynamically renders navigation based on role
- Proper cleanup with OnDestroy
- Null-safe property access

**Key Features**:
- `navigationItems` - Populated from NavigationService
- `showTenantName` - Only shows for tenant-level roles
- `searchPlaceholder` - Role-specific search hints
- Automatic unsubscribe on component destroy

---

### 3. Login Component (UPDATED)
**Location**: `src/app/features/auth/components/login/login-standalone.component.ts`

**Changes**:
- Uses NavigationService for redirect after login
- Single line redirect: `navigationService.getDashboardRoute(user.role)`
- No more switch statement

### 4. Role-Specific Dashboards

#### Platform Admin Dashboard
**Route**: `/platform-admin`
**Content**: Tenants, Revenue, System Health, Quick Actions
**Actions**: Add Tenant, Suspend Tenant, Send Message, View Reports

#### Billing Manager Dashboard
**Route**: `/billing`
**Content**: Revenue, Subscriptions, Payments, Commission Payouts
**Actions**: Export Report, Manage Subscriptions

#### Tenant Admin Dashboard
**Route**: `/admin`
**Content**: Team Members, Subscription Status, Recent Activity
**Actions**: Invite User, Manage Team, Settings

#### Recruiter Dashboard
**Route**: `/dashboard`
**Content**: Jobs, Candidates, Applications, Pipeline, Placements
**Actions**: Post Job, Add Candidate, Schedule Interview

#### Candidate Dashboard
**Route**: `/candidate`
**Content**: Job Recommendations, Application Status, Interviews
**Actions**: Search Jobs, Apply, Update Profile

## How It Works

### Login Flow
1. User enters credentials
2. AuthService authenticates and stores user in localStorage
3. Login component gets user role
4. NavigationService.getDashboardRoute(role) returns correct path
5. Router navigates to role-specific dashboard

### Navigation Flow
1. Main layout subscribes to AuthService.currentUser$
2. When user loads, NavigationService.getNavigationForRole(role) is called
3. Navigation items are rendered dynamically
4. Each role sees only their relevant menu items

### Refresh Flow
1. AuthService loads user from localStorage on init
2. currentUser$ emits the stored user
3. Main layout receives user and updates navigation
4. User stays on current page (no redirect)

## Routes Configuration

```typescript
/platform-admin → PlatformAdminDashboard (PLATFORM_ADMIN, PLATFORM_SUPER_ADMIN)
/billing → BillingDashboard (BILLING_MANAGER)
/admin → AdminDashboard (TENANT_ADMIN)
/dashboard → RecruiterDashboard (RECRUITER)
/candidate → CandidateDashboard (CANDIDATE)
```

## Known Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Navigation not updating on refresh
**Cause**: User not loaded from localStorage fast enough
**Solution**: AuthService loads user in constructor, emits via currentUser$

### Issue 2: Wrong dashboard shown
**Cause**: Hardcoded redirects in login
**Solution**: Use NavigationService.getDashboardRoute()

### Issue 3: All roles see same menu
**Cause**: Static navigation in template
**Solution**: Dynamic navigation from NavigationService

## Next Steps

1. Test each role thoroughly
2. Add loading spinner while user loads
3. Add error handling for missing roles
4. Implement route guards for all protected routes
5. Add breadcrumb navigation
6. Add role-specific quick actions
