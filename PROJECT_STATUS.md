## 📝 Notes

### Architecture Decisions
- Single-tenant model for clients (separate login per agency)
- Candidates search globally across all tenants
- Role hierarchy: PLATFORM_ADMIN > TENANT_ADMIN > RECRUITER > CANDIDATE
- JWT tokens in httpOnly cookies with SameSite=Strict
- NgRx for auth state, Services for data fetching

### Known Issues
- None critical at this time

### Technical Debt
- Test coverage needs to be added
- Bundle size optimization pending
- Performance monitoring not yet implemented
