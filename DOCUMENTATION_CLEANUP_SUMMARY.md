# Documentation Cleanup Summary

**Date:** 2024  
**Action:** Consolidated and cleaned up project documentation

---

## ‚úÖ What Was Done

### 1. Created Master Documents

#### **PROJECT_STATUS.md** - Single Source of Truth for Progress
- ‚úÖ MVP completion status (100% complete)
- üöß Production readiness tasks (organized by priority)
- üìä Technical metrics and targets
- üéØ Next sprint focus areas
- Clear separation of completed vs remaining work

#### **REQUIREMENTS.md** - Complete Requirements Specification
- Functional requirements (all MVP requirements marked complete)
- Non-functional requirements (security, performance, accessibility, etc.)
- Technical requirements and stack
- API endpoints documentation
- Data models
- Success criteria
- Out of scope items (post-MVP)

#### **ARCHITECTURE.md** - Technical Architecture Documentation
- System overview with diagrams
- Frontend architecture (Angular 17+)
- Backend architecture (Spring Boot microservices)
- Database schema
- Security architecture
- API design principles
- Data flow diagrams
- Performance optimization strategies
- Deployment architecture
- Monitoring and logging
- Scalability and disaster recovery

#### **README.md** - Updated Main Documentation
- Quick start guide
- Project structure
- Features overview
- User roles
- Routes documentation
- Configuration
- Testing
- Deployment
- Links to all master documents

---

### 2. Archived Old Tracking Documents

Moved to `archive/` folder (no longer needed):
- ‚ùå COMPLETED_TODAY.md
- ‚ùå DASHBOARD_ROLES_PLAN.md
- ‚ùå IMPLEMENTATION_PROGRESS.md
- ‚ùå IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md
- ‚ùå ROLE_BASED_NAVIGATION_DESIGN.md
- ‚ùå ROLE_BASED_VIEWS.md
- ‚ùå ROLE_NAVIGATION_SPEC.md
- ‚ùå ROLE_SYSTEM_SUMMARY.md
- ‚ùå TOMORROW_PLAN.md
- ‚ùå UI_TESTING_PLAN.md

**Reason:** These were interim tracking documents that are now superseded by the consolidated master documents.

### 3. Kept Essential Documents

These remain in root as they serve specific purposes:
- ‚úÖ AUTH_ARCHITECTURE.md - Detailed auth system documentation
- ‚úÖ BACKEND_FRONTEND_ALIGNMENT.md - API alignment tracking
- ‚úÖ PHASE1_REMAINING_ITEMS.md - Production readiness checklist
- ‚úÖ SUPER_ADMIN_SETUP.md - Setup guide for super admin
- ‚úÖ UI_DESIGN_PHASE1.md - UI design specifications
- ‚úÖ UI_DESIGN_PLAN.md - UI design plan
- ‚úÖ UI_TESTING_PLAN_UPDATED.md - Testing plan
