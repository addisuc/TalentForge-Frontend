## ðŸŽ¯ Quick Verification Commands

### Check Services Running
```bash
curl http://localhost:8081/api/auth/health
curl http://localhost:8082/api/users/health  
curl http://localhost:8083/api/jobs/health
curl http://localhost:8084/api/applications/health
```

### Check Database After UI Testing
```sql
-- Verify data was created via UI
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM job_orders WHERE is_active = true;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM job_applications WHERE is_active = true;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM interviews WHERE is_active = true;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users WHERE role = 'CANDIDATE';
```

## ðŸ“Š Expected Results

After completing this testing plan:

1. **Database populated** with real data created through UI
2. **No hardcoded data** visible anywhere in the application
3. **All 4 sessions working** with real database integration
4. **Complete job management workflow** from posting to hiring
5. **Full candidate experience** from registration to interviews

This approach tests both the UI functionality AND the database integration simultaneously, ensuring everything works end-to-end with real data flow.
